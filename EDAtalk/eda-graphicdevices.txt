What is a Graphics Device?
A graphics device is something where you can make a plot appear
When you make a plot in R, it has to be "sent" to a specific graphics device
The most common place for a plot to be "sent" is the screen device
·
A window on your computer (screen device)
A PDF file (file device)
A PNG or JPEG file (file device)
A scalable vector graphics (SVG) file (file device)

On a Mac the screen device is launched with the quartz()
On Windows the screen device is launched with windows()
On Unix/Linux the screen device is launched with x11()

What is a Graphic Device?
When making a plot, you need to consider how the plot will be used to determine what device the
plot should be sent to.
For quick visualizations and exploratory analysis, usually you want to use the screen device
For plots that may be printed out or be incorporated into a document (e.g. papers/reports, slide
presentations), usually a file device is more appropriate
NOTE: Not all graphics devices are available on all platforms (i.e. you cannot launch the
windows() on a Mac)


How Does a Plot Get Created?
There are two basic approaches to plotting. The first is most common:
1. Call a plotting function like plot, xyplot, or qplot
2. The plot appears on the screen device
3. Annotate plot if necessary
4. Enjoy
library(datasets)
with(faithful, plot(eruptions, waiting)) ## Make plot appear on screen device
title(main = "Old Faithful Geyser data") ## Annotate with a title

How Does a Plot Get Created?
The second approach to plotting is most commonly used for file devices:
1. Explicitly launch a graphics device
2. Call a plotting function to make a plot (Note: if you are using a file device, no plot will appear on
the screen)
3. Annotate plot if necessary
4. Explicitly close graphics device with dev.off() (this is very important!)
pdf(file = "myplot.pdf") ## Open PDF device; create 'myplot.pdf' in my working directory
## Create plot and send to a file (no plot appears on screen)
with(faithful, plot(eruptions, waiting))
title(main = "Old Faithful Geyser data") ## Annotate plot; still nothing on screen
dev.off() ## Close the PDF file device
## Now you can view the file 'myplot.pdf' on your computer

Graphics File Devices
Bitmap formats
png: bitmapped format, good for line drawings or images with solid colors, uses lossless
compression (like the old GIF format), most web browsers can read this format natively, good for
plotting many many many points, does not resize well
jpeg: good for photographs or natural scenes, uses lossy compression, good for plotting many
many many points, does not resize well, can be read by almost any computer and any web
browser, not great for line drawings
tiff: Creates bitmap files in the TIFF format; supports lossless compression
bmp: a native Windows bitmapped format
