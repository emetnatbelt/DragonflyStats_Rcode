Working with R Pacakges
====================================
- Type `library()` onto the command line to find out what packages were installed on your computer
when you put in `R`. 
- Now type `search()` to get a list of the packages from that list that are
already loaded in (installed packages are not necessarily loaded in). 

Installing R Pacakges
====================================

```{r}
install.package("packagename")
download.package("packagename")
```
