Construct a vector of the 0.9, 0.95, 0.975 and 0.99 quantiles of the standard normal distribution.

 

Construct a vector of cumulative distribution functions of the followingvalues

1, 1.28, 1.68, 1.96.

 

Exercise 20

 

Generate a normally distributed random sample of size 300. What is the mean and standard deviation of this sample? What are the 0.9, 0.95, 0.975 and 0.99 quantiles quantiles of this sample? Compare both sets of results.

 

Use R to determine the 90th, 95th and 99th quantiles of a normal distribution, with mean 100 and standard deviation 15.

 

Exercise 21

 

IQ scores are assumed to have a normal distribution with mean 100 and standard deviation 15.

 
1.
What IQ would you have if you were in the 80th percentile?

2.
Estimate the threshold for the top 10 percent?

3.
What is the probability of having an IQ above 142?

4.
What is the probability of having an IQ below 97?


 

 

Exercise 22

 

Use the uniform distribution to simulate 100 throws of two dice. The outcome is the combined values of both dice. Use the appropriate R command to discretize values.

 
1.
What is the mean and standard deviation of the outcomes?

2.
Make a stem-and-leaf plot of the outcomes.

3.
Make a histogram of the outcomes. (hint: use breaks =seq(1.5,12.5))


 

Exercise 23

 

Add up all the numbers for 1 to 50

∙       Using the sum() command.

∙       using a ‘for’ loop.

 

Exercise 24

Create a matrix that contains the pair-wise correlation coefficient of the numeric columns of the ‘Iris’ data. Use nested ‘for’ loops.

 

Exercise 25

Generate a vector of randomly generated numbers (Normal, mean 10, standard deviation 2). Using ‘for’ loops, replace each element that is greater than 11 by the value 11.
