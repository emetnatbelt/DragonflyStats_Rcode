Linear regression model

We can draw a scatterplot to assess the relationship between X and Y.
The commmand we will use is plot.
To fit a linear model,
the relevant r command is lm().
Lets save the output as a data object called Fit1.

Summary()  
is a very useful command when using Linear models.

Correlation and Covariance.

Pearson rho is the most commonly used correlation measure.

Another commonly used measure is the Spearman Rank Correlation. 

covaraince is related to correlation. In fact many students understand it only as an intermediate calculation when computing the correlation.

It is common to express correlations in terms of a matrix. Necessarily the diagonal elements are all ones.

It is possible to directly compute the correlation matrix from the covariance matrix using the functiob cov2cor().
