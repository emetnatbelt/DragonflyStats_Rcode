Motivation
The ability to take data—to be able to understand it, to
process it, to extract value from it, to visualize it, to
communicate it—that’s going to be a hugely important
skill in the next decades, … because now we really do
have essentially free and ubiquitous data. So the
complimentary scarce factor is the ability to understand
that data and extract value from it.
Hal Varian, Google’s Chief Economist
The McKinsey Quarterly, Jan 2009

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
\item One of many approaches to 
data analysis
\item Objectives:
\item Discover patterns
\item Identify anomalies
\item Suggest hypotheses
\item Check assumptions
\item Promoted by John Tukey
%======================================================================================%

Confirmatory vs. 
Exploratory Data Analysis
Confirmatory
\item Start with hypothesis
\item Test the null hypothesis
\item Uses statistical models
Exploratory
\item No hypothesis at first
\item Generating hypothesis
\item Uses graphical methods
%======================================================================================%

Problems with EDA
\item Not rigorous like formal statistical methods
\item Susceptible to specific types of statistical biases
\item Not useful for inference or prediction
\item Not efficient for massive data sets
Note: There are ways to avoid some of these issues


Data Visualization
\item Representation of data 
via visual means
\item Human brain is 
exceptionally good at 
visual pattern recognition
\item Map dimensions of data 
to visual characteristics:
\item Location
\item Size
\item Color
\item ShapeThe term data snooping , sometimes also referred to as data dredging or data fishing , is used to describe the situation in which a particular data set is analyzed repeatedly without an a priori hypothesis of interest. The practice of data snooping, although common, is problematic because it can result in a significant finding (e.g., rejection of a null hypothesis) that is nothing more than a chance artifact of the repeated analyses of the data. The biases introduced by data snooping increase the more a data set is analyzed in the hope of a significant finding.
Dimensionality Reduction is about converting data of very high dimensionality into data of much lower dimensionality such that each of the lower dimensions convey much more information.

This is typically done while solving machine learning problems to get better features for a classification or regression task.

Heres a contrived example - Suppose you have a list of 100 movies and 1000 people and for each person, you know whether they like or dislike each of the 100 movies. So for each instance (which in this case means each person) you have a binary vector of length 100 [position i is 0 if that person dislikes the i'th movie, 1 otherwise ].
You can perform your machine learning task on these vectors directly.. but instead you could decide upon 5 genres of movies and using the data you already have, figure out whether the person likes or dislikes the entire genre and, in this way reduce your data from a vector of size 100 into a vector of size 5 [position i is 1 if the person likes genre i]

The vector of length 5 can be thought of as a good representative of the vector of length 100 because most people might be liking movies only in their preferred genres.

However its not going to be an exact representative because there might be cases where a person hates all movies of a genre except one.

The point is, that the reduced vector conveys most of the information in the larger one while consuming a lot less space and being faster to compute with.

Trimean Formula
An advantage of the trimean as a measure of the center (of a distribution) is that it combines the median's emphasis on center values with the midhinge's attention to the extremes.

rggobi

GGobi is an open source visualization program for exploring high-dimensional data. 
It provides highly dynamic and interactive graphics such as tours, as well as familiar graphics such as the 
scatterplot, barchart and parallel coordinates plots. Plots are interactive and linked with brushing and identification.

GGobi is fully documented in the GGobi book: "Interactive and Dynamic Graphics for Data Analysis".
