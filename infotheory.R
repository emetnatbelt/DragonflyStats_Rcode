Relational operators

<	less than
>         greater than
>=       greater than or equal to

Logical operators



Letters


names = Letters[1:n]



Information Theory :  Entropy


X = c( 0.35, 0.25, 0.20, 0.12, 0.05, 0.03)


sum(X)==1	# True or False


# base  = exp(1) , 2 , 10


b=exp(1)


-X * log(X,b)


sum(-X * log(X,b))





H(X) is the entopy of variable X
