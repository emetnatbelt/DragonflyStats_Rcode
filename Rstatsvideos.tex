2 way Anova


[UoL-EP Stats 2 Question 3 2006 Zone A]


Three lubricants are testing using 15 different cars. Three cars are of brand A, Three from brand B, C, D and E.


Each one of the three cars of each brand used a different lubricant.


Testing took place on the same day and the top speeds in kilometres per hour acheived by each car without

overheating was given in the following table.

%======================================================%

Lub1<-c(176,177,181,171,197)

Lub2<-c(174,172,180,170,191)

Lub3<-c(172,166,177,187,202)

%======================================================%

tab= cbind(Lub1,Lub2,Lub3)

colnames(tab)=c("Lub1","Lub2","Lub3")

rownames(tab)=c("A","B","C","D","E")

%======================================================%

anova(tab)


Give the two way anova table

is there a significant difference between top speeds achieved by the cars

is there a significant difference between top speeds achieved by using different lubricants


%======================================================%


testA<-c(52,54,61,43,95)

testB<-c(48,45,60,42,90)

testC<-c(45,30,58,50,99)
