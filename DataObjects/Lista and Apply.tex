Lists

A list in R is a rather loose objects made of a collection of other arbitary objects known as its components. 

The Apply Family 


The apply() function is a powerful device that operates on arrays and, in particular, matrices. Since it can return arrays, it can bypasses calls to multiple loops and makes for quicker and cleaner programming.



The local version of apply()is lapply(), which computes a function for each argument of a list., provided each argument is compatible with the function argument (e.g. that is numeric). 


A user friendly version of lapply() is sapply()








> x = list( a=1:10, beta =exp(-3:3),logic=c(T,F,T,F))

>

> lapply(x,mean)


$a

[1] 5.5

$beta

[1] 4.535125

$logic

[1] 0.5


>

> sapply(x,mean)

       a     beta        logic

5.500000  4.535125   0.500000
