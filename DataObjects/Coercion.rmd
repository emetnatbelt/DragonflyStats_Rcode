Data Type Coercion and Confirmation
========================================================

A data type, such as numeric, may be coerced (i.e. transformed) into a different data type, such as logical, using the “***as***” family of commands. To coerce an object as logical data, simply use the ***as.logical()*** command. To coerce an object as a character, simply use the ***as.character()*** command.

```{r}
#Coercion
NumVec =c(0,1,1,1,0)

as.logical(NumVec)
as.character(NumVec)
```

The ***is*** family of commands is used to verify whether or not the data is of a certain type. A response is given in the form of a logical vector.
```{r}
#verification
#pi – 3.1415193

is.integer(pi)
is.numeric(pi)
is.logical(pi)
````
