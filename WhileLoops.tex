\subsection{While Loops in \texttt{R}}
The \texttt{while} operator allows a set of commands to be repeated until a specific logical condition is met.

Importantly the logical condition you specify as an argument is the opposite of what you are trying to do.
\subsubsection{Example: The Clever Lecturer}
\begin{framed}
\begin{verbatim}
while( logical condition is meet)
\end{verbatim}
\end{framed}
