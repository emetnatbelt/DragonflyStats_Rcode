R Statistical Programming  - Introduction
 
 








 
The R programming Language was developed by such and such
 
 
 R is a rich environment for statistical computing and has many capabilities
for exploring data in its base package. In addition, R contains a collection of
functions for simulating and summarizing the familiar one-parameter probability
distributions. One goal of this chapter is to provide a brief introduction
to basic commands for summarizing and graphing data. We illustrate these
commands on a dataset about students in an introductory statistics class. A
second goal of this chapter is to introduce the use of R as an environment for
programming Monte Carlo simulation studies. We describe a simple Monte
Carlo study to explore the behavior of the two-sample t statistic when testing
from populations that deviate from the usual assumptions. We will find these
data analysis and simulation commands very helpful in Bayesian computation.

R is a system for statistical computation and graphics.
It consists of a language plus a run-time environment with graphics, a debugger, access to certain system functions, and the ability to run programs stored in script files.
