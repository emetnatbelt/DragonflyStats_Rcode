\chapter{Testing for Normality}
\section{Shapiro-Wilk Test}
The first test we will look at is the Shapiro-Wilk test.
\begin{verbatim}
> shapiro.test(Vec)

        Shapiro-Wilk normality test

data:  Vec
W = 0.9888, p-value = 0.5727
\end{verbatim}
As the p-value is very high, we fail to reject the null hypothesis that the data set ``Vec" is normally distributed.

\section{Normal Probability Plots}

\begin{verbatim}
qqnorm(Vec)  #draws a QQ plot that is used to check for normality.
qqline(Vec)  #adds trend line to QQplot.
\end{verbatim}

\begin{figure}

  \caption{Normal Probability Plot}\label{QQplot}
